To ensure timely completion of your Chrome Extension by the end of this week, here's a **practical, day-wise breakdown of user stories and tasks**, assuming today is **Sunday, June 1** and you plan to finish by **Saturday, June 7 (6 working days)**.

---

### âœ… **Overall Objective**

> Build a Chrome extension using React, Tailwind CSS, and Chrome APIs that **highlights open tabs** based on their **categories (like entertainment, productivity, social media, etc.)**.

---

### ðŸ“… **Day-Wise Plan (June 1â€“7)**

---

### ðŸŸ© **Day 1 (Sunday, June 1) â€” Project Setup & Base Architecture**

**User Stories:**

- As a developer, I want a fully set up dev environment so I can work productively.
- As a user, I want a Chrome extension popup that opens reliably.

**Tasks:**

- Initialize project with React + Tailwind CSS (using Vite or CRA).
- Set up Chrome Extension `manifest.json` (v3).
- Setup popup component with a simple UI.
- Add background script + permissions for tab access.
- Test extension loading into Chrome.

---

### ðŸŸ¨ **Day 2 (Monday, June 2) â€” Tab Reading & Categorization Logic**

**User Stories:**

- As a user, I want the extension to read all currently open tabs.
- As a user, I want my tabs to be categorized based on their domain.

**Tasks:**

- Use `chrome.tabs.query` to fetch all open tabs.
- Extract domain names from tab URLs.
- Define category mapping (e.g., YouTube â†’ Entertainment).
- Create a utility function to return a category for a given domain.

---

### ðŸŸ§ **Day 3 (Tuesday, June 3) â€” Tab Highlighting Logic**

**User Stories:**

- As a user, I want tabs belonging to a category to be highlighted visually on the extension UI.
- As a user, I want to know which tabs fall under which categories.

**Tasks:**

- Store categorized tab list in state.
- Use Tailwind to visually group/highlight tabs by color/category.
- Show category name and list of tab titles/domains under it.
- Allow clicking on a tab to bring it into focus (`chrome.tabs.update(tabId, { active: true })`).

---

### ðŸŸ¥ **Day 4 (Wednesday, June 4) â€” Styling & UI Polishing**

**User Stories:**

- As a user, I want a clean and intuitive UI to view categorized tabs.

**Tasks:**

- Refine Tailwind styling â€” use cards, colors, spacing.
- Add icons/logos for categories (optional).
- Add fallback when no tabs match known categories.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ **Day 5 (Thursday, June 5) â€” Options Page & Manual Category Config (Optional)**

**User Stories:**

- As a user, I want to configure which domains go into which categories.

**Tasks:**

- Add `options.html` and wire it with `manifest.json`.
- Allow user to map custom domains to categories (store in `chrome.storage`).
- Fetch custom mappings and integrate into the categorization logic.

_Skip this step if time is tight._

### ðŸŸ© **Day 6 (Friday, June 6) â€” Testing, Bug Fixing, Optimization**

**User Stories:**

- As a user, I want the extension to be reliable and performant.

**Tasks:**

- Manual test with multiple tabs and windows.
- Edge cases: pinned tabs, discarded tabs, duplicate domains.
- Fix any rendering issues or incorrect categorization.
- Remove unused code, console logs.
- Minify, test extension in incognito (optional).

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Final Delivery (Saturday, June 7)**

**Tasks:**

- Write a `README.md` with installation instructions.
- Package the extension for manual installation (`.zip` with manifest + build).
- Optional: Submit to Chrome Web Store (requires dev account).
- Backup your code (GitHub, etc.).
